# Absenteeism Case Study
*This is a repository where I develop a logistic regression model in Python to predict the probability of an individual being excessively absent from work.*

## Background
This repository showcases a case study in which I address the problem of employees being absent at a company during work hours as part of a Data Science course I completed with 365 Data Science. The business environment of today can be complicated to navigate as people have to balance their professional and personal lives and ensure that neither are adversely affected. Unfortunately it often happens that employees need to sacrifice working hours to deal with personal matters, such as in this case. The company in this case study is concerned that there are too many incidents of employees being absent from work and aims to identify the reasons for this absence and predict the probability of a particular employee being absent in order look at mitigation measures.

## Problem Statement
The business problem will be addressed from the perspective of management who have an incentive to maintain positive productivity. Specifically, we would like to explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time or not. In other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work based on information such as how far they live from their workplace, how many children and pets they have, do they have higher education or whether they have health issues.
